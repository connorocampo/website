Once logged in, click the <b>New site from Git</b> button.\n<br />\n<br />\nFrom there, you'll be able to select GitHub as your Git provider to log in and authorize your account.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>After authorization, select the desired repo you'd like to deploy on Netlify.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>As a side note, Netlify can deploy both public and private repositories for free. Woo!</p>\n<h3><li class=\"blog-post-ol-li\">Once deployed, update DNS in GoDaddy using Netlify DNS records.</li></h3>\n<p>It will take some time for the DNS servers to update. Like, 24 hours or time. Just sit tight. Put a timer on if that makes you feel better. I admit that I did.</p>\n</ol>\n<br />\n<br />\n<h2>Adding an HTTPS/SSL Certificate</h2>\n<br />\n<p>When you configure your nameservers in GoDaddy, you (most likely) will get this error message:\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 25px\">\n<p>DNS verification failed\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>www.yoursitename.com doesn't appear to be served by Netlify\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>We can’t provision a certificate until your DNS configuration is pointing at the Netlify servers and the changes have propagated.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>If you’ve already changed your DNS configuration, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to be processed, or check our troubleshooting guide for some tips on what might be happening.</p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Don't worry ... for now. Allow at least 24 hours for propagation to complete. Propagation won’t happen as quickly as it took for your custom domain name to become active/live. For me it took about 17 hours.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>If the 24 hour mark has passed since updating your nameservers in GoDaddy, then you will have to follow these <a href=\"_https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/troubleshooting-tips/#certificates-and-https\" class=\"is-gradient\" rel=\"noopenner noreferrer\">troubleshooting tips</a>, or reach out to Netlify support for further assistance.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>A nice feature that Netlify provides (for free) is SSL certificate auto-renewal from Lets Encrypt. Once your SSL certificate becomes active, it will automatically renew every 3 months.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Thanks, Netlify, for being a bro.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Configure a Custom Domain in Netlify using GoDaddy Hosting Provider and GitHub","date":"January 18, 2020","category":"Web Development","tags":["Netlify"]},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/web-development/custom-domain-netlify/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/web-development/custom-svg-animations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Custom SVG Animations"}},"next":null}}}
