Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job</h2>\n<br>\n<p>It’s been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy web development agency.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>So far, my work days feel like they’re going by fast, which is good. The phrase, “time flies when you’re having fun” applies here — even though I’ve been sporting my focused learning face ’round the clock.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/photo/stickmanatcomputer.png?zoom=2&w=840&ssl=1\"\nclass=\"placeholder blog-image-mobile\"\n/>\n<br></p>\n<p><i>Fellow co-workers, if you’re lurking this I promise I’m not mad or grumpy. I’m just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!</i>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>What I’ve Been Doing</h2>\n<br>\n<p>My time spent so far has been reviewing the company’s repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>I’ve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I’m not dealing with any clients directly, yet.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Look at a design</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Think about the best way to structure and style it</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Start coding</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Use the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Ask for code reviews after blocks of the design is done</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Refactor code</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Repeat</li>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n<p>Goals with this project:\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Learn the team’s best practices for writing code</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Ask well-informed questions when issues arise</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Not make a fool of myself</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Finish the project in a timely manner</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>It’s been a great learning experience so far — definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>Some Other Things</h2>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Aside from actual work, I’m happy to be near a beautiful park where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks. It’s easy to sit behind the screens and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously so nice.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>Anyway, that's that. Onward I go, cheers ✌🏻</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First Front-End Developer Job 🎉","date":"January 19, 2019","category":"Web Development","tags":["Code"]},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/web-development/first-front-end-development-job/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/web-development/a-non-technical-interview-tip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Non-Technical Job Interview Tip"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/web-development/8-reasons-to-make-a-wordpress-site/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"8 Reasons For Making a WordPress Website"}}}}}
