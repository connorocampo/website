Follow these steps to configure a custom domain in Netlify using GoDaddy Hosting Provider and GitHub.
<br />
<br />

<ol>
<h3><li class="blog-post-ol-li">Deploy site from GitHub account.</li></h3>

Create and log into your Netlify account. Once logged in, click the <b>New site from Git</b> button.
<br />
<br />
From there, you'll be able to select GitHub as your Git provider to log in and authorize your account.
<br />
<br />

After authorization, select the desired repo you'd like to deploy on Netlify.
<br />
<br />

As a side note, Netlify can deploy both public and private repositories for free. Woo!

<h3><li class="blog-post-ol-li">Once deployed, update DNS in GoDaddy using Netlify DNS records.</li></h3>

It will take some time for the DNS servers to update. Like, 24 hours or time. Just sit tight. Put a timer on if that makes you feel better. I admit that I did.

</ol>
<br />
<br />

<h2>Adding an HTTPS/SSL Certificate</h2>
<br />

When you configure your nameservers in GoDaddy, you (most likely) will get this error message:
<br />
<br />

<div style="margin-left: 25px">

DNS verification failed
<br />
<br />

www.yoursitename.com doesn't appear to be served by Netlify
<br />
<br />

We can’t provision a certificate until your DNS configuration is pointing at the Netlify servers and the changes have propagated.
<br />
<br />

If you’ve already changed your DNS configuration, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to be processed, or check our troubleshooting guide for some tips on what might be happening.

</div>
<br />
<br />

Don't worry ... for now. Allow at least 24 hours for propagation to complete. Propagation won’t happen as quickly as it took for your custom domain name to become active/live. For me it took about 17 hours.

<br />
<br />

If the 24 hour mark has passed since updating your nameservers in GoDaddy, then you will have to follow these <a href="_https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/troubleshooting-tips/#certificates-and-https" class="is-gradient" rel="noopenner noreferrer">troubleshooting tips</a>, or reach out to Netlify support for further assistance.

<br />
<br />

A nice feature that Netlify provides (for free) is SSL certificate auto-renewal from Lets Encrypt. Once your SSL certificate becomes active, it will automatically renew every 3 months.

Thanks, Netlify, for being a bro.
