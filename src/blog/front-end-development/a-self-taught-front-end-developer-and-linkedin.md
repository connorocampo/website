Today I received a message on LinkedIn from one of my connections. Here’s a screencap of the message preview from my iPhone: 

*The screencap somehow got deleted, please enjoy this cat noping into a cardboard box instead* 🙃

We chatted briefly on LinkedIn, did a little Q&A and I left the door open for any future questions.

<h2>What This Means To Me</h2>

I was definitely happy to learn that another person became inspired through following my journey as a self-taught front-end developer. Maybe to someone else this might seem like a simple exchange of words, but to me it’s what I live for — inspiring that is.

<h2>Okay, mini-rant over 😅</h2>

At the end of the day, I wanted to write about my pleasant surprise. Thank you for encouraging me to keep at it. I hope you go forward in the direction your heart tells you to!
