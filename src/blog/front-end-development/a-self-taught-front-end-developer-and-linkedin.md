Today I received a message on LinkedIn from one of my connections.

Here’s a screencap of the message preview from my iPhone:

*Screencap somehow got deleted, please enjoy this cat noping into a cardboard box instead* 🙃

We chatted briefly on LinkedIn, did a little Q&A and I left the door open for any future questions.

<h2>What This Means To Me</h2>

I was definitely happy to learn that another person became inspired through following my journey as a self-taught front-end developer. Maybe to someone else this might seem like a simple exchange of words, but to me it’s what I live for — inspiring that is.

Mini-rant: Creating Live Genuine Project is in the top 3 most rewarding things I’ve ever done. Now, with this blog, I hope to spread visibility to the transgender community and connect with all our allies on a larger scale. I don’t want to feel limited by any one thing (like t-shirts). With a blog, I can speak about things that matter — like work, finances and family. There are enough t-shirts in this world, we need more hearts.

So, if I can reach a person, whether it be locally or half a world away, and inspire them to reach for things they wouldn’t have otherwise AND bring awareness to equality — well by my standards that’s a life well-lived.

<h2>Okay, </rant> 😅</h2>
At the end of the day, I wanted to write about my pleasant surprise. Thank you for encouraging me to keep at it. I hope you go forward in the direction your heart tells you to!
