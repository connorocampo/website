This is an update from my post about a non-technical interview tip that led me to get my first front-end developer job.

If you’ve read the above linked post, you’ve read how I prepped for an interview that led me to land my first formally employed full-time gig as a Front-end Developer. Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!

<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job</h2>

It’s been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy consultancy.

So far, my work days feel like they’re going by fast, which is good. The phrase, “time flies when you’re having fun” applies here — even though I’ve been sporting my focused learning face ’round the clock.

Fellow co-workers, if you’re lurking this I promise I’m not mad or grumpy. I’m just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!

<h2>What I’ve Been Doing</h2>

My time spent so far has been reviewing the company’s repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.

I’ve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I’m not dealing with any clients directly, yet.

The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:

Look at a design
Think about the best way to structure and style it
Start coding
Use the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck
Ask for code reviews after blocks of the design is done
Refactor code
Repeat
Goals with this project:

Learn the team’s best practices for writing code
Ask well-informed questions when issues arise
Not make a fool of myself
Finish the project in a timely manner
It’s been a great learning experience so far —  definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.

<h2>Some Other Things</h2>

Humble brag, our office is cool af. We’re located in Orlando Florida, in a space where it overlooks one of my favorite spots in Orlando: Lake Eola.

Aside from actual work, I’m happy to be near a beautiful place where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks.

It’s easy to sit behind the screen and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously 👌🏻

Peace out, y’all ✌🏻
