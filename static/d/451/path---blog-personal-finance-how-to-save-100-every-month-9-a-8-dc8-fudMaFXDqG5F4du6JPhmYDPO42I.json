If you compound that savings year-over-year, you’ve got yourself a nice cash pile starting to build up. The best part is, you can make this happen without having to get a part-time job.</p>\n<h2>$100 Saved Is a Few Clicks Away</h2>\n<p>By unsubscribing from unnecessary monthly subscriptions that you don’t need … or worse, that you don’t even use, you can save over $100 every month! Monthly subscriptions fees seem like small amounts of money, especially when you’re only paying $5 to $20 a month per subscription (iTunes, Netflix, gym membership). But, let’s see what those subscriptions are really costing you.</p>\n<p>Do this exercise to get a better view of your monthly subscriptions: try listing them all out on a scoreboard. Include the name of the subscription service and fee. As you tally up the services, you’ll get the cost of what your paying per month in subscriptions. This cost is usually in excess of $100 😲. </p>\n<h2>The Average American</h2>\n<p>The average American is a natural consumer of products and services. It’s how we were raised and even given praise for when we’d purchase high-priced items.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how an average American’s subscription services rack up:</p>\n<p><u>Monthly Subscription Service Fees</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>iTunes\t$9.99</li>\n<li>Netflix\t$12.99</li>\n<li>Hulu\t$11.99</li>\n<li>Commercial gym + year gym maintenance fee\t$19.99 + maintenance yearly fee ($40)</li>\n<li><b>Total\t$95 plus tax</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>…and that’s without cable which despite having subscribed to streaming services, some people still have.</p>\n<h2>Unsubscribe to Save</h2>\n<p>By simply unsubscribing to services that you don’t need, you’ll find yourself with an extra $100 a month saved. For the cash-strapped, this means food on the table or gas in the tank.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Save $100 Every Month","date":"June 01, 2019"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/personal-finance/how-to-save-100-every-month/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/a-self-taught-front-end-developer-and-linkedin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Self-Taught Developer and LinkedIn"}},"next":null}}
