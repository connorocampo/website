{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is an update from my post about a non-technical interview tip that led me to get my first Front-end Developer job.</p>\n<p>If you’ve read the above linked post, you’ve learned how I prepped for an interview that led me to land my first formally employed full-time gig as a Front-end Developer. Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!</p>\n<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job</h2>\n<p>It’s been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy web development agency.</p>\n<p>So far, my work days feel like they’re going by fast, which is good. The phrase, “time flies when you’re having fun” applies here — even though I’ve been sporting my focused learning face ’round the clock.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/photo/stickmanatcomputer.png?zoom=2&w=840&ssl=1\">\n<p><i>Fellow co-workers, if you’re lurking this I promise I’m not mad or grumpy. I’m just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!</i></p>\n<h2>What I’ve Been Doing</h2>\n<p>My time spent so far has been reviewing the company’s repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.</p>\n<p>I’ve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I’m not dealing with any clients directly, yet.</p>\n<p>The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at a design</li>\n<li>Think about the best way to structure and style it</li>\n<li>Start coding</li>\n<li>Use the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck</li>\n<li>Ask for code reviews after blocks of the design is done</li>\n<li>Refactor code</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Goals with this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn the team’s best practices for writing code</li>\n<li>Ask well-informed questions when issues arise</li>\n<li>Not make a fool of myself</li>\n<li>Finish the project in a timely manner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s been a great learning experience so far —  definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.</p>\n<h2>Some Other Things</h2>\n<p>Aside from actual work, I’m happy to be near a beautiful place where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to sit behind the screen and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously 👌🏻</p>\n<p>Peace out, y’all ✌🏻</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First Front-End Developer Job 🎉","date":"January 19, 2019"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/first-front-end-development-job/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/a-non-technical-interview-tip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Non-Technical Job Interview Tip"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/8-reasons-to-make-a-wordpress-site/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"8 Reasons For Making a WordPress Website"}}}}
