{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job! 🎉</h2>\n<p>This is an update from my post about a non-technical interview tip that led me to get my first front-end developer job.</p>\n<p>If you’ve read the above linked post, you’ve read how I prepped for an interview that led me to land my first formally employed full-time gig as a Front-end Developer. Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!</p>\n<h3>My First Front-End Developer Job</h3>\nIt’s been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy consultancy.\n<p>So far, my work days feel like they’re going by fast, which is good. The phrase, “time flies when you’re having fun” applies here — even though I’ve been sporting my focused learning face ’round the clock.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/photo/stickmanatcomputer.png?zoom=2&w=840&ssl=1\">\n<p>Fellow co-workers, if you’re lurking this I promise I’m not mad or grumpy. I’m just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!</p>\n<h3>What I’ve Been Doing</h3>\nMy time spent so far has been reviewing the company’s repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.\n<p>I’ve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I’m not dealing with any clients directly, yet.</p>\n<p>The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:</p>\n<p>Look at a design\nThink about the best way to structure and style it\nStart coding\nUse the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck\nAsk for code reviews after blocks of the design is done\nRefactor code\nRepeat\nGoals with this project:</p>\n<p>Learn the team’s best practices for writing code\nAsk well-informed questions when issues arise\nNot make a fool of myself\nFinish the project in a timely manner\nIt’s been a great learning experience so far —  definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.</p>\n<h3>Some Other Things</h3>\nHumble brag, our office is cool af. We’re located in Orlando Florida, in a space where it overlooks one of my favorite spots in Orlando: Lake Eola.\n<p>Aside from actual work, I’m happy to be near a beautiful place where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to sit behind the screen and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously 👌🏻</p>\n<p>Peace out, y’all ✌🏻</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First Front-End Developer Job","date":"January 19, 2019"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/first-front-end-development-job/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/notes/pandas-and-bananas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notes Title"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/front-end-development/a-self-taught-front-end-developer-and-linkedin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Self-Taught Developer and LinkedIn"}}}}
